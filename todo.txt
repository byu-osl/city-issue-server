Todo
- Authentication. How do I set up API key stuff?
    - Get a link from Dr. Z that the qualtrics guys talked about
- How will they add services?
    - there's two parts: the public API. The spec is missing a bunch of admin stuff
    - add it! we need new documentation
- Will this ever be used for multiple jurisdictions?
    - Not sure. This could be a big thing. Tons of people using the same server. Let's do it for one now.


- Travis CI
- Spin up remote server so Josh can hit it
- loadDb doesn't quit
- Load services into combo box.
