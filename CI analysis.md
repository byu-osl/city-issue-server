Notes
--------------
+ Search
    * needed to find a phone number
+ Work environment / devices
    * Other responsibilities besides pub. works
    * handles phone calls for issues, takes down necessary info
    * techs have smartphones they might not like to carry on the job
    * desktop computers in the office
    * tablets might be nice for techs
+ Places paper is used
    * work orders - techs come and pick these up in the office
        - status updates are made and signed off
+ Current software
    * iWorks
        - keeps track of issues.
        - already has tons of information, and not just issue tracking. Not sure what the other features are that could be important. Sounds like street dimensions are a part of it, maybe helps keep track of budget somehow. Could have a database with 100k requests already.
        - Importing data is important! Wouldn't be a deal breaker, but wouldn't be fun. Could end up having tons of duplicate data between the programs they use.
        - I can't find this software anywhere online.
    *   arcGIS?
        - This isn't as crucial. A separate map system would be acceptable.
+ Types of issues
    * streets, sidewalks (mentioned a lot), irrigation, potholes, vandalism, parks, streetlights, road signs, lots of less important sub-categories.
+ Field techs
    * they call the residents themselves sometimes
    * no need for directions (small area), addresses might be nice
    * talk a lot to the office, seems like.
    * check in office for work orders
    * take pictures (esp of completed work)
    * only have old phones (for work - they almost all have personal smartphones, but may not carry them on the job. A ban was just lifted on personal phones), but still send Brenda pictures
    * Good to have pictures in status updates
    * issue reqeusts def. not their primary responsibility
    * call Brenda to enter in work orders
    * work on a single issue category if they can
    * only one wireless card for a laptop for field work
    * A tablet could be good
+ Cedar Hills
    * 10k people, generally middle class and wealthy. Some farmers.
+ Issues
    * can stretch out for weeks
    * something about making intials for progress
    * attach technical drawings
    * accuracy is important
    * categories are important
    * 20 work orders in a day, maybe?
    * comes from other folks as well
    * could be concerned about too many requests
    * accurate location is important
    * sometimes there are many issues in the same place
    * priorities mentioned a few times - staff is limited
    * sometimes residents submit unimportant things, or try several times to see if the city will fix it
    * sometimes it is the citizen's problem
    * mapping sounds important
    * issue history seems pretty important
    * color coordination on the map is more important for categories
    * sorting by date should be the default


Questions
-----------------
- How can we discourage reporting trivial things?
- How big is their current database?
- Does Brenda ever get overloaded? What is the volume of updates she has to make in iWorks?
- Do they want to import all data straight into iWorks?
- would it be good for techs to enter in the info themselves instead of Brenda?
- Should editing be in the table they're displayed in?


Features ideas
---------------
- Manually add a request from admin
- A way to view work orders so they don't have to come in
- Work order generation from a request
- images in status updates ***
- associate documents with issues - technical drawings (pdf)
- show old requests when people are submitting in case there duplicates
- search for anything, filter anything
- submitter contact info on the admin map
- easy access links for editing a request
- keep track of which user edited a request
- add prioritization for requests
