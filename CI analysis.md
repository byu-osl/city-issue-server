Notes
--------------
+ Search
    * needed to find a phone number
+ Work environment / devices
    * Other responsibilities besides pub. works
    * handles phone calls for issues, takes down necessary info
    * techs have smartphones they might not like to carry on the job
    * desktop computers in the office
    * tablets might be nice for techs
+ Places paper is used
    * work orders - techs come and pick these up in the office
        - status updates are made and signed off
+ Current software
    * iWorks
        - keeps track of issues.
        - already has tons of information, and not just issue tracking. Not sure what the other features are that could be important. Sounds like street dimensions are a part of it, maybe helps keep track of budget somehow. Could have a database with 100k requests already.
        - Importing data is important! Wouldn't be a deal breaker, but wouldn't be fun. Could end up having tons of duplicate data between the programs they use.
        - I can't find this software anywhere online.
    *   arcGIS?
        - This isn't as crucial. A separate map system would be acceptable.
+ Types of issues
    * streets, sidewalks (mentioned a lot), irrigation, potholes, vandalism, parks, streetlights, road signs, lots of less important sub-categories.
+ Field techs
    * they call the residents themselves sometimes
    * no need for directions (small area), addresses might be nice
    * talk a lot to the office, seems like.
    * check in office for work orders
    * take pictures (esp of completed work)
    * only have old phones (for work - they almost all have personal smartphones, but may not carry them on the job. A ban was just lifted on personal phones), but still send Brenda pictures
    * Good to have pictures in status updates
    * issue reqeusts def. not their primary responsibility
    * call Brenda to enter in work orders
    * work on a single issue category if they can
    * only one wireless card for a laptop for field work
    * A tablet could be good
+ Cedar Hills
    * 10k people, generally middle class and wealthy. Some farmers.
+ Issues
    * can stretch out for weeks
    * something about making intials for progress
    * attach technical drawings
    * accuracy is important
    * categories are important
    * 20 work orders in a day, maybe?
    * comes from other folks as well
    * could be concerned about too many requests
    * accurate location is important
    * sometimes there are many issues in the same place
    * priorities mentioned a few times - staff is limited
    * sometimes residents submit unimportant things, or try several times to see if the city will fix it
    * sometimes it is the citizen's problem
    * mapping sounds important
    * issue history seems pretty important
    * color coordination on the map is more important for categories
    * sorting by date should be the default

- how can we indicate open/closed on the icons?
- 

Annoyances / things to optimize or fix
----------------------------------------
- trivial issue requests / too many requests
- duplication of data in different systems
- techs coming in to check for orders
- keeping track of paper orders
- techs finding exactly where issues are at (sometimes they call the residents)

Priorities (no particular order)
---------------------------------
- data importation
- easy to use status update/history system
- prioritization of issues
- location accuracy
- color categorization

To do list
------------
- [ ] Admin page: Manually add/delete a request?
- [ ] Admin page: edit/manage service categories (sidewalk, potholes, irrigation, etc)
- [ ] Admin page: add links to edit the requests
- [ ] Admin map: submitter contact info on the admin map
- [ ] Admin map: submitter contact info when you click on a request
- [ ] Admin map: color/icon categorize different service types
- [ ] Status updates: allow images
- [ ] Status updates: keep track of which admin edited the status
- [ ] Status updates: email updates for residents
- [ ] Request submission: show open requests on the map
- [ ] Requests: create a page to view individual requests
- [ ] Requests: be able to associate documents
- [ ] Requests: allow prioritization
- [ ] Data importation from/to iWorks?

Questions
-----------------
- How many issues do you have stored in iWorks? How often are you adding requests?
- Do you want to import stuff *from* iWorks or *to* iWorks? What will be the purpose of iWorks after this app is in place? 
- Would it be good for techs to enter in the info themselves instead of Brenda?
- What are all of the different categories you want colors/icons for?
- How would you like to prioritize issues? High, medium, low?
- Do you have any annoyances you'd like to add to the list that the app could help with? Are the ones I listed accurate?
- Do you have any other priorities or features you'd like to the current lists?
- Any other thoughts that you've come up with since I stopped by yesterday?
- Do people only make reports via phone?

- Feature idea: we could prioritize things based on the category. Maybe that would help with people submitting things that are less important.
