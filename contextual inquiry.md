    + emails user what they put in
    + map shows by time, by status
    + they track the potholes
    + show all reported potholes
    + they can report anything they want: want to keep it isolated to potholes
    + typically use the maps - crews use the maps
    + search filter?
        * search for dates repaired for legal 
        * potholes are always high priority
        * still use maps for everything
