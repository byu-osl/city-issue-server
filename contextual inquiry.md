# Notes
Cody from Orem
- udot has one - see click fix
- GIS - map based
- geocortex essentials
- can't click outside of orem
- user clicks, generates an address
- name, email, comment area
    + depending on hour of day, it will email people
    + sends a text to a few people - even asphault. They might fix it if they can. try to get 24 hours
    + emails user what they put in
    + map shows by time, by status
    + they track the potholes
    + show all reported potholes
    + they can report anything they want: want to keep it isolated to potholes
    + typically use the maps - crews use the maps
    + search filter?
        * search for dates repaired for legal 
        * potholes are always high priority
        * still use maps for everything
        * sidewalk issues, streetlights
        * maps are awesome
        * email notifications: not automatic
        * guys on the route use ipads and iphones
    + biggest thing is bringing in to the GIS system
    + esri.com - take a look at that
    + udot see click fix
    + need to visualize all of the issues by category
    + users will report when back home more than out and about
